# Factorial Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a positive integer entered by the user. The program uses a basic loop to calculate the factorial and provides the result as output.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `factorial_calculator.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `factorial_calculator.py`.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
5. The program will prompt you to enter a positive integer.
6. After entering the integer, the program will calculate its factorial and display the result.

## Code Explanation

The program follows these steps:

1. It takes input from the user in the form of a positive integer.
2. It checks whether the input is a non-negative integer.
3. If the input is negative, it displays an error message. If the input is 0, it prints the factorial as 1.
4. For positive inputs, it initializes a variable to store the factorial.
5. It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to the input number and multiplies each iteration value to the factorial variable.
6. Finally, it displays the calculated factorial.

## Example

Let's say you run the program and enter the input as 5. The program will output:
Enter a positive integer: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
